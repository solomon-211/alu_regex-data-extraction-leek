# Regex Data Extraction Tool

This Python project basically elaborates how to extract different data types from the string of texts using the regular expressions(regex)

## Data type to be extracted from the string of texts

- Email addresses
- URLs
- Phone numbers
- Credit card numbers
- Time formats (12-hour and 24-hour)

## Python programming languages used to build, encompasses;
importing modules
- This is to find the matching pattern for the regular expressions and given them a current timestamp
Dictionaries
- A dictionary is used to store different regex patterns and their descriptions to later access the data type need to be extracted.
Raw Strings for Regex
- The r'' prefix stands for raw string, which directs Python not to escape backslashes â€” important for regex patterns to matching their correspomding data type.
Multiline Strings
- To show the multiple line of codes wrapped up in a docstring and stores the data

for Loops and .items()
-This iterates in each patterns and returns the all possible matches patterns.
Sets or Dicts for Removing Duplicates
- This ensures that there are no available duplicates in *sets* or *dicts* and convert back to the list.
Conditionals
- It validates the results before printing them
Datetime Formatting
- This ensures that the timestamp display to be the current or exact time for running code.
Main Guard
- This program ensures the project run successfully.
